## üõ† Configuration Setup

To ensure the secure and proper functioning of the Vira API, developers need to set up essential configuration settings, particularly private keys used in the system. Follow the instructions below to configure the required environment variables before running the application:

### Step 1: Review Configuration Variables

Refer to the `default.json` file located in the `config` folder to identify the environment variables needed for the application.

### Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables

You have two options to set up environment variables:

#### Option 1: Command Line Interface (CLI)

Use the appropriate command based on your operating system to set the environment variables. This approach is more secure as it does not involve writing the sensitive information to a file.

-   **For Windows:**

    ```sh
    set jwtPrivateKey=Your_jwtPrivateKey
    ```

-   **For Linux/Mac:**
    ```sh
    export jwtPrivateKey=Your_jwtPrivateKey
    ```

#### Option 2: Configuration File

Create or modify the `custom-environment-variables.json` in your `config` folder and securely set up your environment variables:

```json
{
    "jwtPrivateKey": "<Your_jwtPrivateKey>",
    "db": "<Your_MongoDB_Connection_String>"
}
```

### üì¢ Important Note:

Whether you choose the CLI or the Configuration File approach, remember, leaving private keys exposed or unset could lead to severe security vulnerabilities. Always set your private keys securely and ensure they are not exposed or accessible to unauthorized individuals.

Ensure the `custom-environment-variables.json` file, if used, is added to your `.gitignore` to avoid committing sensitive information:

```gitignore
config/custom-environment-variables.json
```

### Further Steps:

After setting up the environment variables, continue with any additional setup or installation instructions as appropriate for your project.

By providing clear and secure setup instructions, developers can swiftly configure the required environment variables and get started with using or contributing to the API.

### üì¢ Important Note:

Remember, leaving private keys exposed or unset could lead to severe security vulnerabilities. Always set your private keys securely and ensure they are not exposed or accessible to unauthorized individuals.

## üìö Documentation for Models

### 1. **Customer Model** (`customers.js`)

This model manages customer-related data.

-   **Schema:**

    -   `name`: String (min: 5, max: 50), required
    -   `phone`: String (min: 5, max: 50), required
    -   `isGold`: Boolean, default: false

-   **Validation:**
    -   Uses Joi for validating the provided customer data against the schema.

### 2. **Game Model** (`games.js`)

Manages game-related data, including title, genre, stock number, and rental rate.

-   **Schema:**

    -   `title`: String (min: 5, max: 255), required
    -   `genre`: genreSchema, required
    -   `numberInStock`: Number (min: 0, max: 255), required
    -   `dailyRentalRate`: Number (min: 0, max: 255), required

-   **Validation:**
    -   Uses Joi for validating the provided game data against the schema.

### 3. **Genre Model** (`genre.js`)

Responsible for managing game genre data.

-   **Schema:**

    -   `name`: String (min: 5, max: 50), required

-   **Validation:**
    -   Uses Joi for validating the provided genre data against the schema.

### 4. **Rental Model** (`rentals.js`)

Manages rental data, including the customer, game, dates, and rental fee.

-   **Schema:**

    -   `customer`: customerSchema, required
    -   `game`: gameSchema, required
    -   `dateOut`: Date, default: Date.now
    -   `dateReturned`: Date

## Authentication Route Handler

This JavaScript file defines a route handler for authentication in a video game renting app backend.

### Table of Contents

-   [Introduction](#introduction)
-   [Route Handler](#route-handler)
-   [Validation Function](#validation-function)

### Introduction

This file focuses on the authentication route handler, responsible for handling user login requests and generating authentication tokens.

### Route Handler

The code implements an Express route handler for a POST request to the `/api/auth` URL. It performs the following actions:

-   Validates the request data (email and password) using Joi.
-   Checks if a user with the provided email exists.
-   Compares the provided password with the stored hashed password.
-   Generates and sends an authentication token if the email and password are valid.

#### Validation Function

The `validate` function validates the request object, ensuring it contains an email and password. It utilizes the Joi library to enforce specific validation rules for both email and password.

-   `email`: Validates as a string, min 5 characters, max 255 characters, required, and must be a valid email format.
-   `password`: Validates as a string, min 5 characters, max 255 characters, and required.

The function returns the validation result based on the defined schema.
